# corridor

A simple text adventure game which I've created in late 2012 and early 2013 as an assignment for the [Human-Computer Interaction](http://www.wsi.uni-tuebingen.de/lehrstuehle/human-computer-interaction/home/teaching.html) lecture at Uni TÃ¼bingen.

See `manual.pdf` for instructions on running `corridor.pl` (only tested with [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/)).
